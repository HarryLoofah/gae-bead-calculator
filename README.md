gae-bead-calculator
===================

A simple Python script to help peyote stitch beadworkers start their projects. 
BeadCalculator checks to make sure the number of beads used in a project will
work out mathematically and lets the beadworker know what design elements
will be possible for the number of starting beads entered. 

##To Use:

1. Measure the object that you'll be beading by stringing beads and wrapping thread around the object.
2. Enter the number of beads from the initial measurement around the object.
3. BeadCalculator tells you if that number of beads will work, and if it doesn't, BeadCalculator suggests an alternative number or numbers to start with. 

BeadCalculator also tells the beadworker how many beads to string, how many to add
(when the first two lines of beads are added to the project), and what long 
and short side design elements will be available.
